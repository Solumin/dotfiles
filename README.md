## Dotfiles

A repository containing my configuration files, so that setting up other
machines will be slightly less painful.

Also, being able to track what broke my configs is useful!

**Contents:**

- .globalgitignore: Should be linked to git using `git config --global
  core.excludesfile <path/to/this/repo/globalgitignore>`
- .zshrc and .zsh\_aliases: Zsh configuration, because at this point I'm dependent on it.

See also [my Vim configuration][vimrc], which lives in its own repository.
